# Help Center Prototype for Take Home 
A mock prototype demonstrating operator workflows, metadata-driven content delivery, and AI retrieval (RAG behavior) to demonstrate a new and improved help center / knowledge system experience. Repo to be turned private once presentation is complete.

## Demo Flows

### Operator UX
- Browse the Knowledge Hierarchy
- View Article Health Dashboard (with AI flags)
- Review AI Suggestions for articles
- Create a New Article (mock flow)
- Explore the Article Relationship Network

### Human UX
- Filter and search for help content
- Review Knowledge Hierarchy
- Progressive disclosure (tailored content based on role, tier, and region)

### AI UX
- Mock AI retrieval chat with metadata-aware filtering
- Confidence thresholds and fallback behaviors

## Notes
This is a static prototype - API calls, AI behavior, and submission to database behavior are mocked. Search and AI chat are scripted demos only.
